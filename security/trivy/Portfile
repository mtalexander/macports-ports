    A Simple and Comprehensive Vulnerability Scanner for Containers, Suitable \
    for CI

long_description    \
    {*}${description}. Trivy detects vulnerabilities of OS packages (Alpine, \
    RHEL, CentOS, etc.) and application dependencies (Bundler, Composer, npm, \
    yarn, etc.). Trivy is easy to use. Just install the binary and you're \
    ready to scan. All you need to do for scanning is to specify a target \
    such as an image name of the container.
